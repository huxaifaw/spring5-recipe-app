TESTING
Spring MockMVC - Used to test Spring MVC Controllers
@DirtiesContext - It shuts down the Spring Context for the method annotated with it after running the test.
                  Spring context is loaded again for other methods

 - @PathVariable tells Spring that this variable is extracted from the url

 Command Bean (aka Backing Bean)
 Used to bind data to and from Web Forms in Spring MVC

 Command Objects should be created because as your web application evolve, and you add more data members to your class,
 you might want some of your data not to be shown or set via the web page.
 So, Command Objects are created for making visible the part that you need to be set to or from the web page.
